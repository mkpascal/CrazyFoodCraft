# CrazyFoodCraft

Description
-------------------------

CrazyFoodCraft is a plugin for the Bukkit Minecraft mod.

You are wondering why Glistering Melon is a non-edible item? 
Why not? This plugin will make glistering melon edible by giving you a chance to die in flame or heal you completely.

This is the first version of the plugin, so the item can't be edited. But brace yourself, the next update will brings lots of new option!
